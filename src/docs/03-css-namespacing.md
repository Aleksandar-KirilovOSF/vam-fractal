## Summary

- `c-`:
- `is-`, `has-:`
- `js-`: Reserved hook for JavaScript
- `qa-`: Reserved hook for automated tests
- `fr-`: This is an additional namespace used solely within this documentation - it is used to indicate that the style is for the layout and presentation of this guide and is therefore _not_ in the main V&A stylesheet.
