# V&A Visual Style Guide

View online at [vam-design-guide.surge.sh](https://vam-design-guide.surge.sh).

## Requirements

This visual style guide is built on top of [Fractal](https://github.com/frctl/fractal), a project by [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/). For active development [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed.

The [documentation for Fractal](http://fractal.build/guide) is *super* useful. Have a read through the *Core Concept* documentation before modifying.

## Get going...

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Deployment

Ensure that you have access to deploy to Surge first.

1. `$ npm run deploy`
2. Open your browser to [vam-design-guide.surge.sh](https://vam-design-guide.surge.sh)
